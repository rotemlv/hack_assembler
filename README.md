## Hack Assembler

This repo contains the MSVS solution files for my implementation for the Hack assembler, as described in the nand2tetris.org course.
This project was created by me during the course "Foundational Computing" in Braude's software engineering curriculum.
Due to the pandemic and a lack of time, our course neglected the full-implementation assignment in favor of a more basic assembler variant (one which does not recognize non-predefined symbols).
However, given my passion for this subject, I chose to implement the full assembler in my free time (from scratch, as the aforementioned project was a team project which was implemented differently).

In this repo you will find both the C code and a few .asm examples for code which can be converted to the required Hack binaries (stored as .hack files).

* This repo requires some cleanup as some of the code includes two or more implementations for some functions (for experimenatation).
